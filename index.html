        // Why? It's because that is an array reference, not an array copy. They both point to the same array!
        // So, how do we fix this? We take a copy instead!
        // one way
        const team2 = players.slice();
        // or create a new array and concat the old one in
        const team3 = [].concat(players);

        captain.number = 99;
        // how do we take a copy instead?
        const cap2 = Object.assign({}, person, { number: 99});
        console.log(cap2);
        // We will hopefully soon see the object ...spread
        const cap3 = {...person};
      // Things to note - this is only 1 level deep - both for Arrays and Objects. lodash has a cloneDeep method, but you should think twice before using it.
